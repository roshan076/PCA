## Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for the dimensionality reduction and data analysis. This study explores the application of PCA on distinct datasets: a random Gaussian distribution, iris dataset and the diabetes datasets. By using PCA, a new set of variables known as principal components is derived from the original dataset, capturing maximum variance in the data. The analysis reveals the dominance of certain principal components in capturing data variability and explores the challenges of effectively separating target columns using the extracted components.

## Dependencies

To run the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
